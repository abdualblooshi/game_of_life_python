### I made this code during a computer science course in university, Game of Life which is a really good practice to start getting into coding with Python 3,
## I saw this on a youtube video called [Art of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U&ab_channel=NDCConferences) by Dylan Beattle and he explained the following game rulesets.
